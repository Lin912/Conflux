ORCid (0000-0003-3820-3199)

## PART 1 <Tethra(Release Version 5.2)>
For linux Server we release the Tethra5.2. 
The code used for calculate the dynamic behaivor of cable.

The Porocess Folder contains the PreProcess and PostProcess that include the Jacabian Matrix calculation procedure, Data Processing and Plotting part. 

### 1.1 Theory

### 1.2 Usage process
The code is written by the C++, before download the code you need:

1.Prepare a compilable c++ environment. With download the GNU complier, like gcc, g++ etl;

2.Download and install the Eigen library;

3.Install Cmake and compile the source files according to CmakeLists in the Citrine5 folder. 

Running the Tethra.exe and view the calculations result in the csv folder. The output.csv is the result file.
Then viewing the graphical results with using the code in Python folder, the PostProcess folder includes the Force and Profile result.

Notes:
Specify the CMake source path and the CMake executable path.
